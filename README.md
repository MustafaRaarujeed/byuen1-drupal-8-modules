This repository are for modules that I've created for the projects that I am on that may be of use to the Drupal community.

Modules I've created:

  media_revision_log: This module adds a revision log to the media entity. I made this for stakeholders that wanted to view the revision       log messages of media that their organisation impacts. 
  
  hide_delete_buttons: This module hides the delete button in forms and from AJAX calls from forms. I created this module for stakeholders     that saw that it was too easy to permanently delete a block from the system through the content creation form.
